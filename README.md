# hackaton-project
My first Full-Stack application realized during my training at &lt;/salt>
The core idea of the project is a Trivia Quiz Game, realized during the bootcamp I took in 2023 in Amsterdam.
I fetched the questions from an external API, but due to time constraints I just set the parameter to 
10 questions, easy, regarding geography (my favourite subject when I was a student and when I was a teacher!) 
and multiple choice.
Every time the user clicks the answer, the data is sent to a SQL database, that stores the data.
The frontend page is made in React, using typescript as a template. 
The layout is created with pure CSS (no external libraries for styling).
The backend is realized in C#, in a .NET 7.0 WEB API project.
This was created in a 1,5 day marathon/hackathon, so it will be updated with further functionalities.
If you have questions, git back to me anytime!
